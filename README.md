# Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Competition

There were 4 benchmark models to beat for the kaggle competition, given the public test data set with also, the goal of finding the best statistical model that will generalize well to the private test dataset. The data analysis method and statistical model I attempted for this competition were Linear Regression, Random Forest, Bagging and Boosting.
