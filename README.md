# Machine Learning Kaggle Competition

There were 4 benchmark models to beat for the kaggle competition, given the public test data set with also, the goal of finding the best statistical model that will generalize well to the private test dataset. One of the four statistical model I attempted for this competition, that are, Linear Regression, Random Forest, Bagging and Boosting, I was ultimately able to perform better than all 4 benchmark model.
